# Bentofy Project

This is a one-stop hub of your own life that you can share with all of those arounds you in the form of the trending Bento UI style. With a multiple variety of cards, you can showcase your hobbies and passions through the photo gallery card, or enlighten everyone with your messages using the text card.

This is a visual experience to get to know someone behind a screen. **Link to live project:**[https://bentofy.vercel.app/](https://bentofy.vercel.app/)

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** React, TypeScript, Supabase, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS

ðŸš§Under ConstructionðŸš§

## Future Improvements (Will be implementedðŸ’¯!)

- **Drawable (New Card Type):** Think of it like putting your kid's drawing up on the refrigerator. This card acts like a sticker to add spice into your bento box. If you would like to add flowers into your bento box, then this card would be perfect.
- **Deletion:** So far, once you add a card to your bento, you can't delete it (oops!). This feature will be implemented very soon.
- **Mobile Functionality:** Some buttons overlap with others on the mobile view. The formatting and UI will be improved.
- **Landing Page Design:** The design of the landing page will be improved upon to encourage more usage and to look more professional.
- **Replace Textareas:** You may have noticed that when you view someone's profile (or disabling editmode), that the text in the text cards don't look good. This will be changed.
- **Draggable:** When you don't like the layout of the cards, you'd probably want to drag some around to see how they would look right?
- **More User Customization:** 
  - Changing the background, card, and button colors
  - Changing the background image
  - Bigger card sizes
  - Allow changes in font sizes in text cards
